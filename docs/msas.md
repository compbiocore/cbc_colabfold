# Local MSA Generation

For larger-scale protein structure predictions, in order to avoid issues with rate limiting on the public MSA server, it is best to run the MSA predictions locally, then feed them to the ColabFold notebook for processing. The following steps will guide you through this process. Note that you will need your input protein sequence as a ```.fasta``` file.
