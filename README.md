# Colabfold on OSCAR

## Overview

**ColabFold** is a fast, powerful algorithm based on Google's AlphaFold2 designed to predict a protein's 3D structure from its protein sequence. Using slightly different methods in MSA (multiple-sequence alignment, ColabFold runs up to 3-5x faster than the original AlphaFold with comparable results.
